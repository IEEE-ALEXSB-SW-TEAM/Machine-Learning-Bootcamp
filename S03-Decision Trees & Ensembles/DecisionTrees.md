## What are Decision Trees?

A **Decision Tree** is a supervised machine learning algorithm that uses a tree-like model of decisions by answering a series of questions about the input feature. It's called a "tree" because it starts with a root node and branches out into different paths based on feature values, ultimately leading to leaf nodes that represent predictions.

### Key Characteristics:
- **Non-parametric**: No assumptions about data distribution
- **Interpretable**: Easy to understand and visualize
- **Versatile**: Works for both classification and regression
- **Handles mixed data**: Can work with numerical and categorical features
- **No preprocessing required**: Doesn't need feature scaling or normalization

### Real-world Analogy
Think of decision trees like a flowchart you might use to decide what to wear:
- If it's raining ‚Üí wear a raincoat
- If it's sunny and hot ‚Üí wear shorts and t-shirt
- If it's cold ‚Üí wear a jacket

## How Decision Trees Work

### The Decision-Making Process

1. **Start at the root**: Begin with the entire dataset
2. **Ask a question**: Split the data based on a feature
3. **Branch out**: Create separate paths for different answers
4. **Repeat**: Continue splitting until stopping criteria are met
5. **Make predictions**: Use leaf nodes for final decisions

### Visual Representation

```
                [Root Node]
                Temperature > 20¬∞C?
                /              \
              Yes               No
              /                  \
      [Humidity > 70%?]      [Wear Jacket]
          /        \
        Yes         No
        /            \
  [Use AC]      [Open Windows]
```

### Mathematical Foundation

Decision trees use **recursive binary splitting** to partition the feature space. At each node, the algorithm selects the best feature and threshold that maximizes information gain or minimizes impurity.

## Types of Decision Trees

### 1. Classification Trees
- **Purpose**: Predict categorical outcomes
- **Output**: Class labels (e.g., spam/not spam, cat/dog/bird)
- **Leaf nodes**: Contain class predictions
- **Example**: Email classification, medical diagnosis

### 2. Regression Trees
- **Purpose**: Predict continuous values
- **Output**: Numerical values (e.g., house prices, temperature)
- **Leaf nodes**: Contain average values
- **Example**: Stock price prediction, sales forecasting

### Comparison Table

| Aspect | Classification Trees | Regression Trees |
|--------|---------------------|------------------|
| Target Variable | Categorical | Continuous |
| Prediction | Class label | Numerical value |
| Splitting Criteria | Gini, Entropy | MSE, MAE |

## Key Concepts and Terminology


### Tree Structure Components

#### 1. **Root Node**
- The top most node of the tree
- Contains the entire dataset
- Represents the first decision point

#### 2. **Internal Nodes**
- Nodes with children
- Represent decision points
- Contain splitting conditions

#### 3. **Leaf Nodes (Terminal Nodes)**
- Nodes without children
- Contain final predictions
- End points of decision paths

#### 4. **Branches**
- Connections between nodes
- Represent outcomes of decisions

#### 5. **Depth**
- Maximum number of levels in the tree
- Deeper trees can model more complex patterns

#### 6. **Splitting**
- Process of dividing a node into child nodes
- Based on feature values and thresholds
---
### Important Metrics

#### 1. **Impurity Measures**
- **Gini Impurity**: Measures probability of misclassification
- **Entropy**: Measures information content and uncertainty

#### 2. **Information Gain**
- Reduction in impurity after splitting
- Higher information gain = better split

---

## ‚úÇÔ∏èSplitting Criteria

### For Classification Trees

#### 1. Gini Impurity
The probability of incorrectly classifying a randomly chosen element.

**Formula:**

$$Gini = 1 - \sum_{i=1}^n p_i^2$$

Where: $p_i$ = probability of class $i$

üëâ The feature with the lowest Gini impurity is chosen for the split.

**Example:**
- Dataset: 60% Class A, 40% Class B
- Gini = 1 - (0.6¬≤ + 0.4¬≤) = 1 - (0.36 + 0.16) = 0.48
---

#### 2. Entropy & Information Gain

**Entropy** measures the amount of information or uncertainty in the dataset.

**Formula:**

$$H(S) = - \sum_{i=1}^n p_i \log_2(p_i)$$

Where: $p_i$ is the proportion of class $i$ in the dataset.

üëâ The lower the entropy, the purer the dataset.

**Information Gain** measures how much entropy is reduced when splitting the dataset on a particular feature

**Formula:**

$$IG(S, A) = H(S) - \sum_{v \in Values(A)} \frac{|S_v|}{|S|} H(S_v)$$

Where:
- $A$ = the feature we're considering for the split  
- $S_v$ = the subset of data where feature $A = v$

üëâ The feature that gives the highest information gain is chosen to split the data.

### Example: Entropy & Information Gain

We have a dataset of **10 samples**:  
- 6 **Yes**  
- 4 **No**  

Entropy of the dataset:

$$
H(S) = - (0.6 \log_2 0.6 + 0.4 \log_2 0.4) \approx 0.971
$$

---

Suppose attribute **Weather** has 2 values:

- **Sunny** ‚Üí 4 samples (3 Yes, 1 No)  
  $$
  H(\text{Sunny}) = -\left(\tfrac{3}{4}\log_2 \tfrac{3}{4} + \tfrac{1}{4}\log_2 \tfrac{1}{4}\right) \approx 0.811
  $$ 

- **Rainy** ‚Üí 6 samples (3 Yes, 3 No)  
  $$
  H(\text{Rainy}) = - (0.5 \log_2 0.5 + 0.5 \log_2 0.5) = 1.0
  $$

---

Weighted entropy after the split:

$$
H_{\text{split}} = \tfrac{4}{10}(0.811) + \tfrac{6}{10}(1.0) = 0.924
$$

So, Information Gain:

$$
IG(S, \text{Weather}) = 0.971 - 0.924 = 0.047
$$


üëâ This is a **small gain**, so **Weather** is not a very good attribute for splitting.

## ‚úÇÔ∏èOverfitting and Pruning

#### Signs of Overfitting:
- Very deep trees
- High training accuracy, low test accuracy
- Many leaf nodes with few samples
- Poor generalization

### Preventing Overfitting

#### 1. **Pre-pruning (Early Stopping)**
 Stop growing the tree based on predefined criteria: 
 - Limit tree depth 
 - Set a minimum number of samples required to split a node

#### 2. **Post-pruning**
Build the full tree and then remove branches that don't improve performance

#### 3. **Ensemble Methods**

 - **Bagging**: Combines multiple decision trees to reduce overfitting and improve accuracy.
 - **Boosting**: Builds decision trees sequentially, where each tree tries to fix the errors made by the previous tree.

##  Missing Value Handling

Decision trees can handle missing values naturally:

```python
# Sklearn automatically handles missing values
# For custom implementation:
def handle_missing_values(X, feature, threshold):
    """Handle missing values in decision tree splits"""
    missing_mask = np.isnan(X[:, feature])
    
    if np.any(missing_mask):
        # Option 1: Create separate branch for missing values
        # Option 2: Use surrogate splits
        # Option 3: Assign to most common branch
        pass
```
