# üå≥ Decision Trees 

## What are Decision Trees?

A **Decision Tree** is a supervised machine learning algorithm that uses a tree-like model of decisions by answering a series of questions about the input feature. It's called a "tree" because it starts with a root node and branches out into different paths based on feature values, ultimately leading to leaf nodes that represent predictions.

### Key Characteristics:
- **Non-parametric**: No assumptions about data distribution
- **Interpretable**: Easy to understand and visualize
- **Versatile**: Works for both classification and regression
- **Handles mixed data**: Can work with numerical and categorical features
- **No preprocessing required**: Doesn't need feature scaling or normalization

### Real-world Analogy
Think of decision trees like a flowchart you might use to decide what to wear:
- If it's raining ‚Üí wear a raincoat
- If it's sunny and hot ‚Üí wear shorts and t-shirt
- If it's cold ‚Üí wear a jacket

## How Decision Trees Work

### The Decision-Making Process

1. **Start at the root**: Begin with the entire dataset
2. **Ask a question**: Split the data based on a feature
3. **Branch out**: Create separate paths for different answers
4. **Repeat**: Continue splitting until stopping criteria are met
5. **Make predictions**: Use leaf nodes for final decisions

### Visual Representation

```
                [Root Node]
                Temperature > 20¬∞C?
                /              \
              Yes               No
              /                  \
      [Humidity > 70%?]      [Wear Jacket]
          /        \
        Yes         No
        /            \
  [Use AC]      [Open Windows]
```

### Mathematical Foundation

Decision trees use **recursive binary splitting** to partition the feature space. At each node, the algorithm selects the best feature and threshold that maximizes information gain or minimizes impurity.

## Types of Decision Trees

### 1. Classification Trees
- **Purpose**: Predict categorical outcomes
- **Output**: Class labels (e.g., spam/not spam, cat/dog/bird)
- **Leaf nodes**: Contain class predictions
- **Example**: Email classification, medical diagnosis

### 2. Regression Trees
- **Purpose**: Predict continuous values
- **Output**: Numerical values (e.g., house prices, temperature)
- **Leaf nodes**: Contain average values
- **Example**: Stock price prediction, sales forecasting

### Comparison Table

| Aspect | Classification Trees | Regression Trees |
|--------|---------------------|------------------|
| Target Variable | Categorical | Continuous |
| Prediction | Class label | Numerical value |
| Splitting Criteria | Gini, Entropy | MSE, MAE |
| Leaf Node Value | Mode/Majority class | Mean/Median |

## Key Concepts and Terminology

### Tree Structure Components

#### 1. **Root Node**
- The topmost node of the tree
- Contains the entire dataset
- Represents the first decision point

#### 2. **Internal Nodes**
- Nodes with children
- Represent decision points
- Contain splitting conditions

#### 3. **Leaf Nodes (Terminal Nodes)**
- Nodes without children
- Contain final predictions
- End points of decision paths

#### 4. **Branches**
- Connections between nodes
- Represent outcomes of decisions

#### 5. **Depth**
- Maximum number of levels in the tree
- Deeper trees can model more complex patterns

#### 6. **Splitting**
- Process of dividing a node into child nodes
- Based on feature values and thresholds

### Important Metrics

#### 1. **Impurity Measures**
- **Gini Impurity**: Measures probability of misclassification
- **Entropy**: Measures information content and uncertainty

#### 2. **Information Gain**
- Reduction in impurity after splitting
- Higher information gain = better split

---

## Splitting Criteria

### For Classification Trees

#### 1. Gini Impurity
The probability of incorrectly classifying a randomly chosen element.

**Formula:**
```
$$
Gini = 1 - \sum_{i=1}^n p_i^2
$$

Where:
- $C$ = number of classes
- $p_i$ = probability of class $i$
```
Where pi is the probability of class i.

**Example:**
- Dataset: 60% Class A, 40% Class B
- Gini = 1 - (0.6¬≤ + 0.4¬≤) = 1 - (0.36 + 0.16) = 0.48

#### 2. Entropy (Information Gain)
Measures the amount of information or uncertainty in the dataset.

**Formula:**
```
Entropy = -Œ£(pi √ó log(pi))
```

**Example:**
- Dataset: 60% Class A, 40% Class B
- Entropy = -(0.6 √ó log(0.6) + 0.4 √ó log(0.4)) ‚âà 0.971

#### 3. Information Gain Calculation
```
Information Gain = Entropy(parent) - Œ£(|child|/|parent| √ó Entropy(child))
```

## Overfitting and Pruning

#### Signs of Overfitting:
- Very deep trees
- High training accuracy, low test accuracy
- Many leaf nodes with few samples
- Poor generalization

### Preventing Overfitting

#### 1. **Pre-pruning (Early Stopping)**
 Stop growing the tree based on predefined criteria: 
 - Limit tree depth 
 - Set a minimum number of samples required to split a node

#### 2. **Post-pruning**
Build the full tree and then remove branches that don't improve performance

#### 3. **Ensemble Methods**

 - **Random Forest**: Combines multiple decision trees to reduce overfitting and improve accuracy.
 - **Gradient Boosting**: Builds decision trees sequentially, where each tree tries to fix the errors made by the previous tree.

## Random Forest and Gradient Boost

### Random Forest
- Combines multiple decision trees
- Uses bootstrap sampling and feature randomness
- Reduces overfitting and improves generalization

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

rf = RandomForestClassifier(
    n_estimators=100,        # Number of trees
    max_features='sqrt',     # Features per tree
    bootstrap=True,          # Bootstrap sampling
    random_state=42
)
```

### Gradient Boosting
- Sequentially builds trees to correct previous errors
- Examples: XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingClassifier

gb = GradientBoostingClassifier(
    n_estimators=100,
    learning_rate=0.1,
    max_depth=3,
    random_state=42
)
```

### 2. Missing Value Handling

Decision trees can handle missing values naturally:

```python
# Sklearn automatically handles missing values
# For custom implementation:
def handle_missing_values(X, feature, threshold):
    """Handle missing values in decision tree splits"""
    missing_mask = np.isnan(X[:, feature])
    
    if np.any(missing_mask):
        # Option 1: Create separate branch for missing values
        # Option 2: Use surrogate splits
        # Option 3: Assign to most common branch
        pass
```
